# Midterm Project

Alchemy Code Lab, Devsign Career Track, Winter 2018

## Project Description

By 1 pm next Friday, February 9, your team will present a completed app demonstrating the techniques we've covered thus far in class.

* Make it responsive, using a combination of CSS Grid and Flexbox.
* Follow the Webpack component and router architecture we've used on other labs.
* Allow users to sign up and sign in.
* Store user data using Firebase.
* Protect parts of the app from unauthorized access.
* Implement responsive image loading strategies.
* Apply the principles of Chapter 3 of *Don't Make Me Think!* to make body copy scan-friendly.
* **Test** users along the way to make sure you're on the right track.
* Be mindful of places where subtle CSS animations could aid usability.

Your final app should be deployed to Github pages for presentation.

### Competition Analysis

Who are your direct competitors? Your indirect competitors? What are the strengths and weaknesses of those competitors?

* Goals while using your site

### UX Strategy Document

Remember to keep your strategy brief, two pages maximum. This should include

* **A vision statement**, stating the goals of this project and the benefits users can expect from your product
* **Circumstances of use**, which is a brief summary of work done in your personas. Who uses this app, and under what conditions?
