# Midterm Project

Alchemy Code Lab, Devsign Career Track, Winter 2018

## Project Description

By 1 pm next Friday, February 9, your team will present a completed app demonstrating the techniques we've covered thus far in class.

* Make it responsive, using a combination of CSS Grid and Flexbox.
* Follow the Webpack component and router architecture we've used on other labs.
* Allow users to sign up and sign in.
* Store user data using Firebase.
* Protect parts of the app from unauthorized access.
* Implement responsive image loading strategies.
* Apply the principles of Chapter 3 of *Don't Make Me Think!* to make body copy scan-friendly.
* **Test** users along the way to make sure you're on the right track.
* Be mindful of places where subtle CSS animations could aid usability.

Your final app should be deployed to Github pages for presentation.

## Initial Requirements

Review your notes on the research/discovery and strategy phases of the UX process. **By Monday morning**, you should have completed the following:

### Competition Analysis

Who are your direct competitors? Your indirect competitors? What are the strengths and weaknesses of those competitors?

### User Personas

Describe the circumstances of the use of your app. For each persona, include

* Name and photo
* Level of technical expertise
* Typical browsing behaviors
* Goals while using your site

Think carefully about user **stories** here. How would each user find your app in the first place? What would they have in mind as they arrive? What specific steps would they take in (hopefully) arriving at their goal? What discoveries might they make along the way?

### UX Strategy Document

Remember to keep your strategy brief, two pages maximum. This should include

* **A vision statement**, stating the goals of this project and the benefits users can expect from your product
* **Circumstances of use**, which is a brief summary of work done in your personas. Who uses this app, and under what conditions?
* **UI design criteria**. What are your interface design goals?
* **Success metrics**. How would you measure whether your product is successful?
